Any business logic which has to be executed wheather the client send the request we have to provide code inside service() method.

URL stands for "Uniform Resorce Locator" we have to use the following format for the URL.
  http://ipaddress/contextpath/resource
  
  
If System.out.println() in the servlet.
Server execute the servlet and display the output on the server.

To send the output to client we have to write the content inside response object.
If we write the content in the response object, server will convert response object into http response format and send the output to the browser.
